<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Fowler <span class="citation" data-cites="fowler">(Fowler 1999)</span></p>
<p>Measure theory of continued fractions: Einsiedler and Ward <span class="citation" data-cites="einsiedler">(Einsiedler and Ward 2010Chapter 3)</span> and Iosifescu and Kraaikamp <span class="citation" data-cites="iosifescu">(Iosifescu and Kraaikamp 2002Chapter 1)</span>.</p>
<p>In harmonic analysis and dynamical systems, we usually care about infinite continued fractions because we usually care about the Lebesgue measure of a set defined by some conditions on the convergents or partial quotients of a continued fraction. For some questions about functions defined using continued fractions in which we speak about the continuity or differentiability of a particular function, we do indeed care about rational numbers. This paper assembles and comments on the Euclidean algorithm and finite continued fractions in classical Greek and medieval Latin mathematics.</p>
<h1 id="numbers-and-magnitudes">Numbers and magnitudes</h1>
<p>Plato, <span><em>Parmenides</em></span> 140b–c <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford">(Cornford 1939, 126)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, the One, being such as we have described, will not be either (a) equal or (b) unequal either to itself or to another.</p>
<p>If it is equal, it will have the same number of measures as anything to which it is equal. If greater or less, it will have more or fewer measures than things, less or greater than itself, which are commensurable with it. Or, if they are incommensurable with it, it will have smaller measures in the one case, greater in the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allen <span class="citation" data-cites="allen">(Allen 1997, 4:236–41)</span> comments on this passage.</p>
<p>Aristotle, <span><em>Metaphysics</em></span> D.13, 1020a <span class="citation" data-cites="metaphysica">(Ross 1928)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Quantum’ means that which is divisible into two or more constituent parts of which each is by nature a ‘one’ and a ‘this’ . A quantum is a plurality if it is numerable, a magnitude if it is measurable. ‘Plurality’ means that which is divisible potentially into non-continuous parts, ‘magnitude’ that which is divisible into continuous parts; of magnitude, that which is continuous in one dimension is length, in two breadth, in three depth. Of these, limited plurality is number, limited length is a line, breadth a surface, depth a solid.</p>
<p>Again, some things are called quanta in virtue of their own nature, others incidentally; e.g. the line is a quantum by its own nature, the musical is one incidentally. Of the things that are quanta by their own nature some are so as substances, e.g. the line is a quantum (for a ‘certain kind of quantum’ is present in the definition which states what it is), and others are modifications and states of this kind of substance, e.g. much and little, long and short, broad and narrow, deep and shallow, heavy and light, and all other such attributes. And also great and small, and greater and smaller, both in themselves and when taken relatively to each other, are by their own nature attributes of what is quantitative; but these names are transferred to other things also. Of things that are quanta incidentally, some are so called in the sense in which it was said that the musical and the white were quanta, viz. because that to which musicalness and whiteness belong is a quantum, and some are quanta in the way in which movement and time are so; for these also are called quanta of a sort and continuous because the things of which these are attributes are divisible. I mean not that which is moved, but the space through which it is moved; for because that is a quantum movement also is a quantum, and because this is a quantum time is one.</p>

<p>Polybius <span><em>Histories</em></span>, Book IV, Chapter 40:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For given infinite time and basins that are limited in volume, it follows that they will eventually be filled, even if silt barely trickles in. After all, it is a natural law that, if a finite quantity goes on and on increasing or decreasing – even if, let us suppose, the amounts involved are tiny – the process will necessarily come to an end at some point within the infinite extent of time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gelon after his victory honored with gifts not only those cavalry who had killed Hamilcar, but also others who had distinguished themselves in the battle. He put aside the best of the booty to decorate the temples of Syracuse. Of the remainder, he nailed much of it to the most magnificent temples of Himera and the rest along with the captives he distributed to his allies according to the number of their soldiers who had fought with him.</p>

<p>Aristotle, <span><em>Topics</em></span> VIII.3, 158b29–35 <span class="citation" data-cites="LCL335">(Thomas 1991, 506–7)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would seem that in mathematics also some things are not easily proved by lack of a definition, such as the proposition that the straight line parallel to the side which cuts the plane divides in the same way both the line and the area. But when the definition is stated, what was stated becomes immediately clear. For the areas and the lines have the same <span><em>alternating subtraction</em></span> (<span><em>antanairesis</em></span>); and this is the definition of the same proportion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexander of Aphrodisias, <span><em>On the Topics</em></span>, VIII.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For likewise when this is stated it is not obvious; but when the definition of proportion is enunciated it becomes obvious that both the line and the area are cut in the same proportion by the line drawn parallel. For the definition of proportions which those of old time used is this: Magnitudes which have the same <span><em>alternating subtraction</em></span> (<span><em>anthyphairesis</em></span>) are proportional. But he has called <span><em>anthyphairesis</em></span> <span><em>antanairesis</em></span>.</p>

<p>Fowler <span class="citation" data-cites="fowler">(Fowler 1999)</span> is a comprehensive summary of Greek writings about ratios and anthyphaeresis. In Fowler’s formalization, for magnitudes <span class="math inline">\(x,y, x&gt;y\)</span>, the <strong>anthyphaeresis</strong> of the ratio <span class="math inline">\(x:y\)</span> is the sequence <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> formed when applying the Euclidean algorithm with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="the-euclidean-algorithm">The Euclidean algorithm</h1>
<p>Weil <span class="citation" data-cites="weil">(Weil 1984, 5, Chap. I, §II)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was there originally a relation between the so-called “Euclidean algorithm,” as described in <span><em>Eucl.</em></span>VII.1–2, for finding the g.c.d. of two integers, and the theory of the same process (<span><em>Eucl.</em></span>X.2) as it applies to possibly incommensurable magnitudes? Has it not often happened that a mathematical process has been discovered twice, in different contexts, long before the substantial identity between the two discoveries came to be perceived? Some of the major advances in mathematics have occured just in this manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his introduction to Book V of Euclid’s <span><em>Elements</em></span>, Heath says the following <span class="citation" data-cites="euclidII">(Heath 1956, 113)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the theory of proportions is twice treated in Euclid, in Book V. with reference to magnitudes in general, and in Book VII. with reference to the particular case of numbers. The latter exposition referring only to commensurables may be taken to represent fairly the theory of proportions at the stage which it had reached before the great extension of it made by Eudoxus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this paper we talk only about using the Euclidean algorithm with commensurable magnitudes, equivalently, about finite continued fractions. This gives us a chance to become familiar with the Euclidean algorithm just as it occurs in <span><em>Elements</em></span> VII.1–2, rather than in <span><em>Elements</em></span> VII.1–2 and <span><em>Elements</em></span> X.2–3 together.

<p>The Porism to <span><em>Elements</em></span> VII.2 states, “From this it is manifest that, if a number measure two numbers, it will also measure their greatest common measure.”</p>
<p>Proclus, <span><em>Commentary on the First Book of Euclid’s Elements</em></span> 301–302 <span class="citation" data-cites="proclus">(Morrow 1992, 236)</span>, calls determining the greatest common measure of two commensurable magnitudes a “porism”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Porism” is a geometrical term and has two meanings. We call “porism” a theorem whose establishment is an incidental result of the proof of another theorem, a lucky find as it were, or a bonus for the inquirer. Also called “porisms” are problems whose solution requires discovery, not merely construction or simple theory. We must see that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal, and our knowledge in such cases is about already existing things. Bisecting an angle, constructing a triangle, taking away or adding a length – all these require us to make something. But to find the center of a given circle, or the greatest common measure of two given commensurable magnitudes, and the like – these lie in a sense between problems and theorems. For in these inquiries there is no construction of the things sought, but a finding of them. Nor is the procedure purely theoretical; for it is necessary to bring what is sought into view and exhibit it before the eyes. Such are the porisms that Euclid composed and arranged in three books.</p>

<p>That the ancients best knew the distinction between these three things, is clear from their definitions.

Suppose by contradiction that there is some number <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that is a common measure of <span class="math inline">\(A,B,C\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E&gt;D\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> measures each of <span class="math inline">\(A,B\)</span>, by <span><em>Elements</em></span> VII.2, Porism <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> measures their greatest common measure <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.

<p>We can now say that in every triangle the three angles are equal to two right angles. But we must find a method of discovering for all the other rectilineal polygonal figures – for four-angled, five-angled, and all the succeeding many-sided figures – how many right angles their angles are equal to. First of all, we should know that every rectilineal figure may be divided into triangles, for the triangle is the source from which all things are constructed, as Plato teaches us when he says, “Every rectilineal plane face is composed of triangles.” Each rectilineal figure is divisible into triangles two less in number than the number of its sides: if it is a four-sided figure, it is divisible into two triangles; if five-sided, into three; and if six-sided, into four. For two triangles put together make at once a four-sided figure, and this difference between the number of the constituent triangles and the sides of the first figure composed of triangles is characteristic of all succeeding figures. Every many-sided figure, therefore, will have two more sides than the triangles into which it can be resolved. Now every triangle has been proved to have its angles equal to two right angles. Therefore the number which is double the number of the constituent triangles will give the number of right angles to which the angles of a many-sided figure are equal. Hence every four-sided figure has angles equal to four right angles, for it is composed of two triangles; and every five-sided figure, six right angles; and similarly for the rest.</p>

<p>For any rectilineal figure, as we said earlier, is as such divisible into triangles, and we have given the method by which the number of its triangles can be found. Therefore by dividing the given rectilineal figure into triangles and constructing a parallelogram equal to one of them, then applying parallelograms equal to the others along the given straight line – that line to which we made the first application – we shall have the parallelogram composed of them equal to the rectilineal figure composed of the triangles, and the assigned task will have been accomplished. That is, if the rectilineal figure has ten sides, we shall divide it into eight triangles, construct a parallelogram equal to one of them, and then by applying in seven steps parallelograms equal to each of the others, we shall have what we wanted.</p>

<p>The Greeks cannot speak of ‘<span class="math inline">\(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n\)</span>.’ What they must do is to use, effectively, something like a dot-representation: the general set of numbers is represented by a diagram consisting of a <span><em>definite</em></span> number of lines. Here the generalisation procedure becomes very problematic, and I think the Greeks realised this. This is shown by their tendency to prove such propositions with a number of numbers above the required minimum. This is an odd redundancy, untypical of Greek mathematical economy, and must represent what is after all a justified concern that the minimal case, being also a limiting case, might turn out to be unrepresentative. The fear is justified, but the case of <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span> is only quantitatively different from the case of <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span>. The truth is that in these propositions Greek actually prove for particular cases, the generalisation being no more than a guess; arithmeticians are prone to guess.</p>
<p>To sum up: in arithmetic, the generalisation is from a particular case to an infinite multitude of mathematically distinguishable cases. This must have exercised the Greeks. They came up with something of a solution for the case of a single infinity. The double infinity of sets of numbers left them defenceless. I suspect Euclid was aware of this, and thus did not consider his particular proofs as rigorous proofs for the general statement, hence the absence of the <span><em>sumperasma</em></span>. It is not that he had any doubt about the truth of the general conclusion, but he did feel the invalidity of the move to that conclusion.</p>
<p>The issue of mathematical induction belongs here.</p>
<p>Mathematical induction is a procedure similar to the one described in this chapter concerning Greek geometry. It is a procedure in which generality is sustained by repeatability. Here the similarity stops. The repeatability, in mathematical induction, is not left to be seen by the well-educated mathematical reader, but is proved. Nothing in the practices of Greek geometry would suggest that a proof of repeatability is either possible or necessary. Everything in the practices of Greek geometry prepares one to accept the intuition of repeatability as a substitute for its proof. It is true that the result of this is that arithmetic is less tightly logically principled than geometry – reflecting the difference in their subject matters. Given the paradigmatic role of geometry in this mathematics, this need not surprise us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ancients had before them the problem of reckoning the months by the moon, but the years by the sun. For the legal and oracular prescription that sacrifices should be offered after the manner of their forefathers was interpreted by all Greeks as meaning that they should keep the years in agreement with the sun and the days and months with the moon. Now reckoning the years according to the sun means performing the same sacrifices to the gods at the same seasons in the year, that is to say, performing the spring sacrifice always in the spring, the summer sacrifice in the summer, and similarly offering the same sacrifices from year to year at the other definite periods of the year when they fell due. For they apprehended that this was welcome and pleasing to the gods. The object in view, then, could not be secured in any other way than by contriving that the solstices and the equinoxes should occur in the same months from year to year. Reckoning the days according to the moon means contriving that the names of the days of the month shall follow the phases of the moon.</p>

<p>We define a day to be a period from a sunset to the next sunset, a synodic month to be a period from a new moon to the next new moon, and a tropical year to be a period from a vernal equinox and the next vernal equinox. Two days need not have the same number of seconds, but this discrepancy is tiny and we shall model the phenomena by taking the period from any sunset to the next and from any other sunset to the next to be the same, and we call this common period <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Likewise, we shall model the phenomena by taking the period from any vernal equinox to the next and from any other vernal equinox to the next to be the same, and we call this common period <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Finally, we shall model the phenomena by taking the period of a large number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of consecutive synodic months to be nearly <span class="math inline">\(N \cdot M\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is called the mean synodic month.</p>

We partition time into hollow and full months, and take as given that (iii) this is done in such a way that among <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> consecutive synodic months, there are more full months than hollow months.

Assume that <span class="math inline">\(pY\)</span> is nearly <span class="math inline">\(NM\)</span>.

<blockquote>
<p>Following the Demiurgic generation of the spheres and the procession of the seven bodies, and following their ensoulment and the order instituted among them by the Father, and after their various motions and the temporal measures of each of their periods and the differences among the completions of their cycles, the account has proceeded to the monad of time’s plurality and the single number in terms of which every motion is measured – a measure by which all the other measures have been encompassed and in terms of which the entire life of the cosmos has been defined, as well as the diverse articulation of bodies and the universal lifespan that takes place across the all-perfect period. Now this number is one that must not be thought about in a manner that corresponds to opinion – just successively adding ten thousands upon ten thousands – for there are people who are accustomed to speak this way. They take an accurate figure for the completion of the Moon’s cycle and likewise for the Sun and multiply both; then they multiply these by the complete cycle for Mercury on top of this, and then that for Venus on top of these, and then Mars to all that, and then similarly for Jupiter and the remaining cycle for Saturn. On top of all that, they take the complete cycle for the sphere of the fixed stars and make the single and common complete cycle of the planets. Anyway, they could talk about it in this manner, if in fact the times for the completion of the cycles were prime to one another. If, however, they aren’t prime to one another, then they will need to take their common measure and see how many times this number goes into each of the periods it takes for the completion of a cycle. Then, taking the number of times this goes into the smallest one, they multiply the larger number by it. Conversely, taking the number of times this goes into the larger number, they will need to multiply the smaller number by that. By means of both of these operations of multiplication they will arrive at the same period which is common to both of the complete cycles – a period which is thus time measured by both of them. These are the sorts of things that people like that say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We shall now investigate how we may have a method of discerning whether numbers are prime and incomposite, or secondary and composite, relatively to each other, since of the former unity is the common measure, but of the latter some other number also besides unity; and what this number is.</p>
<p>Suppose there be given us two odd numbers and some one sets the problem and directs us to determine whether they are prime and incomposite relatively to each other or secondary and composite, and if they are secondary and composite what number is their common measure. We must compare the given numbers and subtract the smaller from the larger as many times as possible; then after this subtraction subtract in turn from the other, as many times as possible; for this changing about and subtraction from one and the other in turn will necessarily end either in unity or in some one and the same number, which will necessarily be odd. Now when the subtractions terminate in unity they show that the numbers are prime and incomposite relatively to each other; and when they end in some other number, odd in quantity and twice produced,’ then say that they are secondary and composite relatively to each other, and that their common measure is that very number which twice appears.</p>
<p>For example, if the given numbers were 23 and 45, subtract 23 from 45, and 22 will be the remainder; subtracting this from 23, the remainder is 1, subtracting this from 22 as many times as possible you will end with unity. Hence they are prime and incomposite to one another, and unity, which is the remainder, is their common measure.</p>
<p>But if one should propose other numbers, 21 and 49, I subtract the smaller from the larger and 28 is the remainder. Then again I subtract the same 21 from this, for it can be done, and the remainder is 7. This I subtract in turn from 21 and 14 remains; from which I subtract 7 again, for it is possible, and 7 will remain. But it is not possible to subtract 7 from 7; hence the termination of the process with a repeated 7 has been brought about, and you may declare the original numbers 21 and 49 secondary and composite relatively to each other, and 7 their common measure in addition to the universal unit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If two numbers are composite to one another, a greater and a smaller, how can their largest and their smallest common measure be found? From the larger number let the smaller be subtracted as often as possible; then let whatever amount is left from the former [larger] number be subtracted from the smaller number as often as possible. The amount of the difference will be the greatest measure of these numbers. Take the numbers 350 and 100. Let one hundred be subtracted as often as possible from 350, which is three times. The remainder is 50. From the other number of the pair, one hundred, let 50 be subtracted; the remainder is 50. This number is the greatest common measure of 350 and 100; for fifty times two is one hundred, and fifty times seven is 350. From this calculation it becomes clear how one finds, of all the numbers which measure two numbers, their greatest common measure.</p>

<p>Domninus of Larissa, <span><em>Encheiridion</em></span> 20–31 <span class="citation" data-cites="domninus">(Riedlberger 2013, 2:111–15)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>20. Every number, when compared to an arbitrary number with regard to the multitude of monads in them, is either equal to it, or unequal. If they are equal to one another, their relationship to one another will be unique and not further distinguishable. For in the case of equality, one thing cannot be in this fashion and the other thing in that fashion, since what is equal is equal in one single and the same way. If, however, they are unequal, ten different relationships can be contemplated concurrently.</p>
<p>21. But before giving an account of these, we must state that it is true for every pair of numbers that the lesser is either a part, or parts, of the greater number, since, if it measures the greater one, it is a part of the greater number, such as in the case of 2 which measures 4 and 6, of which it is a half or a third part, respectively. If it does not measure it, it is parts of it, such as in case of 2, which, not measuring 3, is two thirds of it, or in the case of 9, which, not measuring 15, is three fifths of it.</p>
<p>22. Having stated this as a preliminary, we say that if those two numbers which lie before us for inspection are unequal, the lesser either measures the greater, or it does not.</p>
<p>23. If it measures it, the greater number is a multiple of the lesser one, and the lesser number is a submultiple of the greater one, as in the case of 3 and 9, since 9 is a multiple of 3, being its triple, and 3 is a submultiple of 9, being its subtriple.</p>
<p>24. If it does not measure the greater number, and if one subtracts it from it once or several times, it will leave behind something less than itself whch will, by necessity, be either a part, or parts, of the number. For it will leave behind either a monad or some number.</p>
<p>25. If it leaves behind a monad, it obviously leaves behind a part of itself. For the monad is part of every number, since every number is a combination of monads.</p>
<p>26. If it leaves behind some number, it will be either a part of itself, or parts. For it is true for every pair of numbers that the lesser is either a part, or parts, of the greater.</p>
<p>27. Now then, if the lesser number is subtracted once from the greater, and it leaves behind a number less than itself which is a part of it, then the greater number will be superparticular to the lesser, while the lesser number will be subsuperparticular to the greater, as in the case of 2 and 3. For 3 is superparticular to 2, since it includes it and a half of it (therefore, it is also called sesquialter of it), while 2 is subsesquialter to 3. And the same is the case with 6 and 8, as 8 is sesquitertian to 6, while 6 is subsesquitertian to 8.</p>
<p>28. If the remainder is parts of the lesser number, then the greater number will be superpartient, while the lesser number will be subsuperparticular to the greater, as in the case of 3 and 5. For 5 is superpartient to 3, since it includes it and two thirds of it (therefore, it is also called superbitertian of it), while 3 is subsuperbitertian to 5. And the same is the case with 15 and 24, as 24 is supertriquantan of 15, since it includes it and three fifths of it, while 15 is subsupertriquintan of 24.</p>
<p>29. If the lesser number is subtracted more often than once from the greater, and it leaves behind a number less than itself which is part of it, then the greater number will be multiple-superparticular, while the lesser number will be submultiple-superparticular to the greater, as in the case of 2 and 5. For 5 is multiple-superparticular to 2, since it includes it twice and a half of it (therefore, it is also called duplex-sesquialter of it), while 2 is subduplex-sesquialter to 5. And the same is the case with 6 and 26, as 26 is quadruplex-sesquitertian to 6, while 6 is subquadruplex-sesquitertian to 26.</p>
<p>30. If the remainder is parts of the lesser number, then the greater number is multiple-superpartient, while the lesser number is submultiple-superpartient to the greater, as in the case of 3 and 8. For 8 is duplex-superbitertian to 3, while 3 is subduplex-superbitertian to 8. And the same is the case with 10 and 34, as 34 is triplex-superbiquintan of 10, while 10 is subtriplex-superbiquintan of 34.</p>
<p>31. And these are the so-called ten relationships of inequality, to which the ancients also referred as ratios:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>multiple,</p></li>
<li><p>submultiple,</p></li>
<li><p>superparticular,</p></li>
<li><p>subsuperparticular,</p></li>
<li><p>superpartient,</p></li>
<li><p>subsuperpartient,</p></li>
<li><p>multiple-superparticular,</p></li>
<li><p>submultiple-superparticular,</p></li>
<li><p>multiple-superpartient,</p></li>
<li><p>submultiple-superpartient.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the theory of numbers with regard to one another according to the multitude underlying them.</p>

<p>The method by which we can find such numbers, if someone proposes them to us and declares that it is not known whether they are commensurable in any measure or [whether] the unit alone measures each, is this. Should two unequal numbers be given, it will be necessary to subtract the smaller from the greater, and if what remains is greater, subtract the smaller from the greater again; [but] if it is smaller, subtract it from the greater [number] that remains, and this should be done until [either] unity finally prevents any further diminution, or, if each of the numbers proposed is odd, some number [is reached that is] necessarily odd; but you will see that the number which is left is equal to that [odd] number. And so it is that if this subtraction should, in turn, reach one, the numbers are said to be prime to each other necessarily and they are conjoined by no other measure except unity alone. If, however, the end of the subtraction arrives at some [odd] number as was said above, it will be a number that measures each sum, and we call the same number that remains the common measure of each.</p>
<p>Take two proposed numbers with respect to which we do not know whether some common measure measures them; let these be <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(29\)</span>. Now we make an alternate subtraction. Let the smaller be subtracted from the greater, that is, <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(29\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> is left; let us now again subtract the smaller, that is, <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span> is left; I again subtract <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> from the remainder [i.e., <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>] and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> remains. If I subtract this from <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> is left, and if I again take <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> remains; and from this another <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> remains, which after it is diminished by another <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> leaves only unity. Again, if I subtract one from two, the end of the subtraction is fixed at one, which shows that there is no other common measure of these two numbers, namely <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(29\)</span>. Therefore, we will call these numbers prime to each other.</p>
<p>But should other numbers be proposed in the same situation, that is <span class="math inline">\(21\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>, they could be investigated since they would be mutually related. Again I subtract the quantity of the smaller number from the greater, that is, <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(21\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> remains. From <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> I take <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> remains, which if subtracted from <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> leaves <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>; and if <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> were taken from <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> would be left, from which <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> cannot be subtracted for it is equal to it. For <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, which was reached by continually subtracting, cannot be subtracted from <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, since they are equal. Therefore, we shall pronounce them commensurable, and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, which is the remainder, is their common measure.</p>

Yet another rule says: Using the numerator of the fraction, subtract it (successively) from the denominator; using the remainder as denominator, subtract it (successively) from the numerator; use what is equal to (both) numerator and denominator as the divisor; then it is possible to divide both the numerator and denominator by this number.

<p>Euclid, <span><em>Elements</em></span> VII.20 <span class="citation" data-cites="euclidII">(Heath 1956, 320)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><em>Elements</em></span> VII.20 is equivalent to the statement that if a number measures a product of two numbers and is relatively prime to one of the two numbers then it measures the other number. Taisbak <span class="citation" data-cites="taisbak">(Taisbak 1971, 25:9, Chapter 1)</span> says about <span><em>Elements</em></span> VII.20,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as cited above it sounds trivial, at most somewhat impenetrable. Almost all the arithmetical theorems of the Elements have that stamp of impenetrability to a modern reader, and my experience is that they open only to the patient reader and even then only to one who is prepared to give up his preconceived opinions as to what Euclid’s theory of proportions is all about.</p>

<p>If two numbers by multiplying make some number, and any prime number measure the product, it will also measure one of the original numbers.</p>
